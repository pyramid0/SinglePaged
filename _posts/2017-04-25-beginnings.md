##### Humble Beginnings

The vision for this B-sides is simple: Give interested techies a place to start and gain a foothold in the security community.  Our organizers have attended Big Cons, Little Cons, and ones in between.  Every con brings something amazing to the people that attend: community.  The local security community in STL is vibrant.  We want to continue growing that community by holding a free event that can introduce the interested to the connected.

This is a free conference with local speakers and hackers showing technologies they love and talking about how they have gotten involved in the greater Security Community.

Bring your notebooks, handout business cards, have a few drinks with other like minded techies!
